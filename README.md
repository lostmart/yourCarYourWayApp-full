## 📋 Overview

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the live chat functionality of the Your Car Your Way car rental application. This PoC demonstrates the technical feasibility of real-time communication between customers and support agents using WebSocket technology.

## Purpose

This PoC validates the core architecture decisions for the Support Service microservice, specifically:

- Real-time bidirectional communication via WebSockets
- Utilization of STOMP protocol for message routing
- Integration with Spring Boot and Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- Message persistence and chat session management
- Integration between Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend
- Database design for chat storage

**Note:** This is a simplified implementation focused on proving the concept. It is not a production-ready application.

## 🏗️ Architecture Alignment

This PoC implements a subset of the Support Service from the Your Car Your Way architecture:
